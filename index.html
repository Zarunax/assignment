      <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Zarunax, although some of you may know me as Josh. I am a
        part-time, small streamer based in the East of England, and I go live
        each week over at <a href="https://twitch.tv/zarunax">Twitch</a>, where
        you can find me playing a mixture of games. Whether I am building badly
        and dying a lot in survival games, getting confused and failing at story
        games, or even getting made to scream by my chat using jumpscares during
        horror games, you can be sure of one thing- I will always try to make it
        fun, lighthearted and welcoming.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have also uploaded a couple of videos over at
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@zarunax">YouTube</a>, which I plan to
        do more of in future, from Twitch stream highlights and clips to vocal
        content, and hopefully some gaming series' too! Be sure to head on over
        there, drop me a follow and hit that notification button to keep updated
        when I start posting again!
